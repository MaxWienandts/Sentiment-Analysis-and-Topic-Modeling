# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Topic-Modeling
Sentiment Analysis (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT) and Topic Modeling (LDA).

Abstract: \
This project will analyze and implement several models of sentiment analysis and topic definition.  The applied models were Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), DistilBERT (a distilled version of BERT), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The specific problem statement that this project will answer are “Is BERT and DistilBERT appropriate to sentiment analysis? Is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) appropriate for topic modeling?”. To answer these questions, it was used a dataset with 1,676,974 observations from Kaggle with positive and negative enterprise reviews from Glassdoor. Moreover, it has made available 4 Jupyter notebooks “1 ETL and EDA.ipynb”, “2 LSTM BERT DistilBERT.ipynb”, “3 Topic modeling.ipynb”, and “4 Production.ipynb”. These notebooks will guide users on how to train and apply these models to a new dataset or in a specific new review. The results of this project will show that not always it is worth to use state of the art models such as BERT and DistilBERT, and that despite the simplicity of the LDA model, this algorithm is appropriate for topic modeling.

Problem Statement:
-  Is BERT and DistilBERT appropriate to sentiment analysis? Is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) appropriate for topic modeling?

This project have 4 Jupyter notebook:
- 1 ETL and EDA.ipynb;
- 2 LSTM BERT DistilBERT.ipynb;
- 3 Topic modeling.ipynb; and
- 4 Production.ipynb.

They should be runned in order. \
The objective of the first notebook is to known better our dataset and to clean it. \
The second notebook have the models related to sentiment analysis. \
The third one have the topic modeling. \
Finally, the last notebook is an example to how to apply the sentiment and topic models to an dataset and to a custom review.

Moreover, there is a report "Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling - Max Wienandts.pdf" where can be found the sections:
